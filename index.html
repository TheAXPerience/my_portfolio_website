                <p>
                    It all started back in the year 2012.  Entering the foreign realm of high school, I chanced upon a class teaching computer programming and became enamored with it immediately.<br/><br/>
                    Scratch that - it starts way farther back than that. I've always been surrounded by technology growing up and have always been curious about software; how it's made and how it brought so much joy to my childhood.<br/><br/>
                    Now, after years of education and practice, I am putting what I've learned to use. All the hard work, the many projects, puzzles, and challenges I've met and faced, has been leading me to now. Writing programs for leisure, entertainment, quality of life - that's what it's all about to me.<br/><br/>
                    Have a job that needs doing? You can count on me.<br/><br/>
                    Feel free to contact me at any time. Look forward to hearing from you.

                    Together with my partner, Alexey Beall, we developed several iterations of the game,
                    each one improving from the previous using statistics we collected from players.
